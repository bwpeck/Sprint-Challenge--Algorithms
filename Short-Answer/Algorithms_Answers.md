#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) The while loop will continue (n) times so a (n) increases the amount of time will increase equally


b) O(n) The function will be linear as the for loop will run through the range dependent on (n), the while loop only running part of the time


c) O(n) This is a quadratic function as it recursively calls itself (n) times

## Exercise II
Start at the middle floor of the building, drop the egg off the ledge. If it breaks, go down to the floor that is the middle point between the ground floor and the middle floor you were just on. if it doesn't break, go up to the middle floor between the floor you were just on and the top, rinse and repeat until answer is found

Run time complexity O(log n)
